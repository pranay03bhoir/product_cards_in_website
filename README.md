# product_cards_in_website
This is a demonstration/project demonstrating how product cards are created on a website for the user's ease of viewing a product with a brief description. 
I have also made a cart counter which increments as a product is added to the cart and decrements when an item is removed from the cart.
These product cards are made using Bootstrap (CSS framework using HTML) & Javascript.
